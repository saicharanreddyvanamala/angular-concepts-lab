<h3>useExisting Demo</h3>
<button class="btn btn-primary" (click)="isLogged()">Click to log</button>
<p> Check console and you see the the isLogged value it will be true because i have used the useExisting so the instance of the LoggerService will be used and the isLogged value is true in
  the LoggerService.So Due to useExisting the same instance is being logger here.
